    CSS Snapshot 2007 links to all the specifications that together represent
    the state of CSS as of 2006. Because large parts of CSS are still under
    development and it is often difficult to know what their state is, the CSS
    working group decided to publish this document, which contains only the parts 
    of CSS that are stable and have been shown to work.CSS Snapshot 2010 links 
    to all the specifications that together represent the state of CSS as of 2010.
    With this document, the CSS WG aims to help implementors distinguish between 
    the parts of CSS that are ready for production and the parts that are still experimental.
